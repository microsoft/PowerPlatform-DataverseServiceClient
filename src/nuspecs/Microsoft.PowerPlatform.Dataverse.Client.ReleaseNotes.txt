++CURRENTRELEASEID++
Fixed and issue with the client being non-castable to IOrganizationServiceAsync, Client will now cast again. (Internal Report)
    Special note: 
        IOrganizationServiceAsync has async methods without cancellation support. this is required for service mapping as the dataverse server does not natively support this feature. 
        IOrganizationServiceAsync2 has async methods WITH cancellation support.  
        This surfaces in the client as 2 forms of each async method and is currently necessary to support internal auto generation of contracts for service communication. We will work to improve this in the future.
        Cancellation events will currently raise an OperationCancelled Exception, this can either be the topmost exception, or embedded in a DataverseException.
        Cancellation methods are 'preferred' if you need to support cancellation in your application.
Fixed an issue with External authentication type not being properly passed though to cloned clients.  (git #162)

0.5.2:
***** Breaking Changes *****
Removed the constructor:
    public ServiceClient(OrganizationWebProxyClient externalOrgWebProxyClient, ILogger logger = null)
        Removed as we are refactoring how we will accept an external created client for internal use cases.
Contract change:
    Added Support to set token file storage location back to connection string and constructors supporting User Authentication.
    Modified DiscoverOrganizationsAsync to return a new return object called DiscoverOrganizationsResult
    Modified Exception type thrown when external authentication fail to return DataverseOperationExecption vs general exception.

    Auth flow Logging capture is still under development.

Authentication constructors are now updated to remove some ADAL.net patterns
Removed Token Cache path from constructors and ignore on connection string at this time
    Token Cache handle support will be revisited, however if you have a pressing need, we recommend you use the external token management constructor in the mean time and self manage that.
    For now, only MSAL In-Memory support will be provided for token cache
Refactored to support Shared HTTPClientFactory for WebAPI connections to cut down on some noise for folks that are doing repeated logins.
Refactored code a bit to help with clarity on various functional areas.
Renamed/Refactored Discovery methods to as Async methods.

Added new Exception, CdsClientOperationException - this will be used when an exception is raised via the CDSClient when CDSClient is using WebAPI.
Added IntelliSense Doc Support
Added support for bypassing custom Plug-in Execution during SDK Operation.
    This is a special use capability that requires a specialized permission in the CDS infrastructure to use.
    Currently this is only permitted for use by users that have the System Administrator Security Role.

0.2.16-Alpha:

 Rerouted CdsServiceClient Helpers to use WebAPI path for CUD requests.

0.2.2-Alpha:
Several updates to Create / Update / Delete operations to move the underlying features over to use the WebAPI.
Please report any bugs that you run into with this.  This has been "mostly" tested with our current test suite, however we have not full tested all data type translation at this point.

0.2.1-Alpha:
BREAKING CHANGE!!!
Altering Nuget Version to 3 digit semantic version
Namespace change from Microsoft.Powerplatform.xxxx to Microsoft.PowerPlatform.xxxx
Fixed an error with setting CallerId when ClientSecret Auth type is used.
    Thanks for all the bug reports on this and repro's that really helped us run it down.

0.0.1.11-Alpha:
Fixed a number of discovery related issue that were broken during the port.
Added new forms of DiscoveryGlobalOrganziations to allow for a token function to be passed to enabled this for use in WebSites and functions where it makes sense.
Updated several sovereign GEO's configs to reflect use of Global discovery for those GEOs

    This would manifest as a missing method exception when trying to create a sequential guid.

0.0.1.9-Alpha:
Fixes a bug in using ExecuteCdsWebRequest that blocked connections using clientSecretAuth types.

0.0.1.8-Alpha:
Removed IOverrideAuthHookWrapper and property and replaced with a new constructor form.
    This capability was replaced with a new constructor that accepts a function pointer as a parameter to the constructor.
    This user provided function takes the form of string FunctionName (string InstanceUri),  When called, the current instance URI will be
    passed in and the function is expected to return an access token for access to that instance.
    This form allows an given instance of the CdsServiceClient to be associated with a Auth Processor vs having the auth processor at the process level.

Fixed a bug reported in .clone in .net core builds.  When cloning a connection in .net core, the system would think you were using an invalid auth type.

Known issues:
    None at this time.. Please report any issues on the GitHub Issues site.


0.0.1.7-Alpha
    Fixed a Nuget Package dependency issue in Microsoft.Dynamics.Sdk.Messages

0.0.1.6-Alpha
Intial Alpha release of Microsoft.Cds.Client.CdsServiceClient
    WARNING: This is an ALPHA release.
    This library is a rename and renamespace of the Microsoft.Xrm.Tooling.Connector.CrmSeriviceClient.
    If you are familiar with the CrmServiceClient,  By Renaming each occurrence of Crm to Cds, you should find that API's match up.
    Major changes from CrmServiceClient:
        This library does not support User Interactive or User Password Auth flows in .net core.
        This library does not support AD or ADFS login to OnPremise,
            to use against an onPrem instance of CDS, your instance must be configured with
            ADFS + OAuth and the application ID you wish to use registered.
        This library removes several Dynamics specific helper methods from CrmServiceClient.
            this additional methods can be found by include the nuget package Microsoft.Cds.Client.Dynamics
